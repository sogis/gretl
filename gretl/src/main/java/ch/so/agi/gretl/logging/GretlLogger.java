/**
 * Logger used in all GRETL classes. As Gretl is based on a build tool, it uses
 * the special lifecycle log level which informs gretl users on start and finish
 * of the processing of one step. Consequently, each step must have exactly two
 * lifecycle log outputs. One when starting the execution of the Step (after
 * input validation). One after finishing the execution of the Step (after
 * cleanup). Info is used for more detailed feedback to the user. Debug is used
 * for very detailed output that should help in debugging a problem. Error is
 * used to log Exception messages. Priority of the logOutput: error &gt; lifecycle
 * &gt; info &gt; debug. Example: Setting the loglevel to lifecycle means that
 * lifecycle and error logs will be output
